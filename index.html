        <div class="subheading mb-5">English Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Hello! My name is Natalie Glasgow. I am a first year English major at the University of California, Riverside. I have maintained a high grade point average throughout all of high school and now into college. I have had no professional experience thus far, but I have been in a number of important organizations and leadership rolls. Firstly, I was a part of the National Honor Society, a community volunteering organization, for two years while in high school. I volunteered over thirty hours each year. Each event required the volunteers to sign up for different events benefiting the community, such as making meals for the homeless, managing activities for minority organizations, or even helping out with activities at elementary schools. I was also a part of my high school’s Young Democrats Club. Not only did I help establish the club, but I held the position of treasurer for two years, where I would act as the middle person between our sponsor and the members of the club. Additionally, I was a part of my high school’s Drama Club for four years, two of which I held officer positions. The first year I held the title of Clerk, where I helped with backstage production, such as organizing the cast parties and communicating with the costume design team. The second year, I was the President of the club. I was in charge of organizing and leading monthly meetings, organizing and gathering supplies for all of our events, such as blanket making for cancer patients, advertising all upcoming productions, and managing the other officers, as well. <br><br>

        Although I have had no professional experience, next school year, 2020-2021, I was hired for the position of Resident Advisor, or RA. I went through an extensive interview process. There were thousands of applicants and they only hired one hundred and forty-two total student staff members. There was a series of three interviews, two group-based and one individual. As a Resident Advisor next year, I will hold the position for ten months. Numerous tasks are involved in the undertaking of the job. The most important and prominent is that I will be in charge of a hall of residents, students living in the dorms on campus. I will have to be sure that they enforce the rules, and take appropriate measures when they fail to do so. I will also have to hold all meetings, and help the residents on move in day get acquainted with their new home. <br><br>

        Additionally, I will be a mandated reporter and hold three community engaging events every quarter, so they residents can learn about school and hall policies while mingling with their neighbors. I will also be in charge of creating and putting up posters in the hall that detail the different resources available to students on a variety of topics, ranging from where they can find tutoring, to what the intricacies of studying abroad, and where they could go to seek mental/physical help, if need be. I will also have nights where I am on call from seven pm to eight am, in case there is a minor emergency, noise complaint, or something along those lines, the residents have somebody safe to call to handle the issue appropriately. Overall, I am incredibly excited to grow in this position and challenge myself while helping my residents to have a wonderful and safe first year at UCR!
